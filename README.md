# Final Project â€“ Proposal Submission  

## Project: Monitoring a Containerized URL Shortener Webservice  

### Project Description  
This project focuses on developing and monitoring a fully containerized URL shortener webservice.  
The application will allow users to shorten long URLs and redirect them using short codes.  
The service will be instrumented with Prometheus metrics to monitor its performance and health.  
Grafana will be used to visualize these metrics and provide insights into usage trends.  
The entire stack, including the application and monitoring tools, will run locally using Docker and Docker Compose.
